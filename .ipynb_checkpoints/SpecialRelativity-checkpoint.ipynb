To show what this implies, we can imagine an experiment that includes two reference frames moving relative to each other at a constant velocity with a light flash that occurs when they are aligned at time zero.  The below is a diagram of the situation some time after the light flash."

For one thing, the form is correct no matter if the velocity has positive or negative components, so this simplifies things a bit.  Now, let us take the situation as determined in the primed reference frame.  If we had a normal transformation (the usual classical transformation, we could make the following substitution: "
